## About
I am a geographer with a strong interest in wildfire as a cultural and environmental process and risk.  
My research evolves around social, organisational and policy dimensions of wildfire in Europe. I am trained in using both qualitative methods (interviews, field observations, content analysis) and quantitative methods (surveys, questionnaires, remote sensing data).  
I have basic skills in GIS, R, Python, Adobe Illustrator. 

I am on the 2025-2026 job market.
